## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to retreive temperature data for June and December in Oahu, and to generate summary statistics in order to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.

## Results

* The mean temperatures in Oahu for June and December are similar, with December's mean temperature being only about four degrees lower than June's.
* June and December have similar maximum temperatures (June's is 85 degrees while December's is 83 degrees), but December has a much lower minimum temperature than June (56 degrees compared to 64 degrees).
* The interquartile range for June temperatures is four degrees, while for December it is five degrees. Both months have standard deviations of slightly over three degrees, telling us that the minimum and maximum temperatures are likely rare and we can usually expect temperatures closer to average for both months. 

## Summary

From this analysis, we can conclude that the ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round. Temperatures in both June and December on Oahu are similar and do not seem to vary much from the low- to mid-70s. Two more queries we could perform to further our analysis could be to filter results for the months of June and December for only the station with the most temperature observations (station USC00519281), and to look at June and December temperatures only within the last year.
